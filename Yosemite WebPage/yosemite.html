         <p> Yosemite valley is located in northen California and is part of Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is well known for it's steep granite cliffs that makes up the main valley and spectacular water falls that cascade into the valley. The geology of the Yosemite area is made up by granite rocks and remnants of older rock. About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevadas where beginning to form; an uplifted in the landscape increased the steepness of stream and rivers resulting in formation of deep canyons. About a million years ago, snow and ice formed, glaciers at the higher alpine meadows moved down the river valleys. The downslope movement of the ice masses sculpted the U-shaped valley that we see today.</p>
